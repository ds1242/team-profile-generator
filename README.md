  ## About/Description

  This project uses Inqurirer to take in input from users about a team of employees.  There are three types of employees that can be added, a Manager, an Engineer, and an Intern.  It also asks for the employee id and email.  There are questions specific to each role such as an Engineer will only be asked to add their github or a Manager must add their office number.  Once the user has completed their input, it will then add this information to an array that creates an index.html page with cards for each employee and displays their infomration.  This project also has several tests as it was built using test driven development to check each object created.
